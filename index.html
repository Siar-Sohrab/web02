        <h1>KBUL AFGHANISTAN</h1>
        <H2>Kabul – the fifth fastest growing city in the world – is bursting at the seams</H2>
        <p>Kabul, Persian Kābol, city, capital of the province of Kabul and of Afghanistan.<br> The largest urban centre in the country and also its political and economic hub, the city forms one of several districts of Kabul province.<br> It lies at the intersection of roads that lead to Uzbekistan (via Mazār-e Sharīf) to the north, Pakistan (via Jalālābād) to the east, and Kandahār to the south.<br> A settlement has existed at or near Kabul for some 3,500 years, but it was not until the early 20th century that the city extended north of the Kabul River.<br> This growth continued through the 1980s, when villagers from areas affected by the Afghan War (1978–92) migrated to the relative safety of Kabul.<br> Fighting between factions who occupied the city in 1992 resulted in significant damage and displacement of the urban population.<br> The city has witnessed unprecedented growth since the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks.</p>
